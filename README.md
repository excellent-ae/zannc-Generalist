# Hades Generalist Gameplay/QOL Mod
### Some General "QOL" changes, such as Starting Room Drop Manager, Max Grasp and Pom Stacking changes, all configurable through ImGUI.<br>

Starting Room Manger allows you to choose who/what you want to see when you start a new run. <br>
----------------<br>
Pom of Power Changes allow you to change the +level for the poms, and allows you to optionally disable the diminishing returns that occur when you upgrade a boon too many times. <br>
----------------<br>
Max Grasp allows you to change your maximum grasp to account for all the cards total, works even if you add new cards with different costs!
